# Spherical Field Theory (SFT) Quantum Simulator

This project is a simulation based on the observable forces we know of in 3 dimensional space plus time (3+1D) operating at the Planck/Quantum scale. The model is a computational toy model derived from an effective Lagrangian.

This was built as a way to answer a question that i had: "What if the quantum level was made of discrete interacting spheres?"

I made this simulation, hand-tuned it and was able to achieve metastability of proton-like clusters that were forming.

After that i was able to use the data i recorded and below are the equations that this model now incorporates. 

When switching from hand-tuned forces to Lagrangian based forces, the Kinetic Energy after about 2100+ frames out of 5000 would hit a perfect stability across increasingly larger particle count runs of the simulation.

Yes, this model uses a classical framework. Yes, this model uses force-field based interactions, which are related to force-field based Molecular Dynamics.

Yes, the model is showing possible quantum-like emergent behavior that i did not specifically code.

## üìê Theoretical Foundation

This model incorporates:

- The **effective Lagrangian** captures repulsive, attractive, and confining components through a custom interaction potential.

  ```L = Œ£·µ¢ (¬Ω m * |v·µ¢|¬≤) - Œ£_{i<j} [ A / (3 * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|¬≥) - (B / 2) * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|¬≤ + C * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º| ]```
  
- A **Hamiltonian diagnostic** tracking kinetic, potential, and total energy at each frame, below is the Hamiltonian equation:

  ```H = Œ£·µ¢ (p·µ¢¬≤ / 2m) + Œ£_{i<j} [ A / |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|¬≥ - B * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|¬≤ + C * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º| ]```

- A **Euler-Lagrange** Derived force law:

  ```m * a·µ¢ = Œ£_{j ‚â† i} [ (A / |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|‚Å¥) - B * |x·µ¢ - x‚±º| - C ] * (x·µ¢ - x‚±º) / |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|```

These derivations bring classical modeling closer to quantum-like emergence ‚Äî with potential for further theoretical analysis.

## üìä Results & Data Reproducibility

All test environments used the same workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beelzebarb/sft.git
cd sft
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sft-cpu.py --headless
```

No manual patching or system-specific modifications required.

‚úîÔ∏è Runs consistently across Python 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12.

Each run generates a full log folder containing:
- `summary.csv` ‚Äî per-frame energy, cluster, and spatial statistics
- `proton_lifetimes_by_frame.csv` ‚Äî histogram of proton lifetimes over time
- `quantum_logs.csv` ‚Äî per-frame quantum activity: spin flips, color flips, timestep, and Hamiltonian diagnostics
- `metadata.json` ‚Äî config snapshot for full reproducibility

These results have been validated across a range of particle counts (`N=180` to `N=3000`) and environments, demonstrating long-term metastability or full stability.

## üìÇ Batch Results

Benchmark runs (`N=180` through `N=3000`) are stored under `/results`, each with logs and metadata for reproducibility:

```

## üß† What Is This?

A testbed for **Spherical Field Theory** (SFT), a novel idea that quantum behavior may emerge from interactions between discrete spheres under force laws that reproduce exclusion, binding, and attraction. It offers a new route to model **zero point energy**, **proton formation**, and possibly **quantum fluctuations** from classical mechanics.
