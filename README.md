# Spherical Field Theory (SFT) Quantum Simulator

Spherical Field Theory is the idea that at the most basic and small scale, the Planck-scale, that there exist discrete interacting spheres that only interact with local neighbours.

The idea for this theory came from the brilliance of Paul Dirac's work, and his belief in total and complete Locality. This principle is the entire thing that allows SFT to work as it does. 

This project has had a lot of ups and downs, I thought it was dead when I couldn't get the system to function without scaffolding holding it up in the code, that it was dead, but that has been resolved.
It now maintains stability through 100,000 frames deterministic across linux and windows and desktop and server hardware still, but the force equations have been completely redone.

The entire theory now operates on a custom usage of the Morse potential and a new implementation named Dirac Core Pressure, which acts as a short-range quantum exclusion force.

**Personal Note:** This entire idea is because of Paul Dirac, and his vision and philosphy of locality. He inspired me to have the idea, to make the simulation and now because of that i decided to name the short-range quantum exclusion force as the Dirac Core Pressure, his philosphy and work live on.

Also, Philip M. Morse, who developed the Morse potential now used in this theory and the simulation, thank you for your amazing and excellent work, it lives on today as well inside SFT.

### Observed behavior since fine tuning the system using the new force equations:

- **Energy-Driven Mass Emergence**
  - Energy is the first state. As it concentrates through clustering, it becomes mass ‚Äî which resists motion and deepens gravitational influence.
  - Because mass is energy, this clustering draws in more energy, increasing mass further.
  - Clustering ‚Üí Energy Density ‚Üë ‚Üí Gravity ‚Üë ‚Üí Clustering ‚Üë
  - The result is a feedback loop: clustering increases energy density, which increases gravitational pull, which in turn amplifies clustering.
- **Relativisitc Behavior from First Principles**
  - The system respects a speed limit that was never defined in the code or equations.
  - It exhibits mass-energy conversion, local time dilation (via adaptive timestep), and resistance to acceleration ‚Äî all purely from geometric interaction.
- **Emergent Decoherence Storms ("Spin Storms")**
  - The system builds tension over time. When local density and force exceed a threshold, the field enters a state of quantum instability:
  - a rapid, storm-like burst of spin flips occurs.
  - These storms:
    - Release pressure without breaking relativistic constraints
    - Get shorter, but more intense over time
    - May be part of a self-regulating cycle to maintain field stability
	- Only happen under deterministic runs, using --fast which enables parallel calculations, storms do not occur.

These behaviors are not programmed.
They emerge from the model itself ‚Äî from locality, force, and motion alone.

## üìê Theoretical Foundation


The custom potential energy function combines attractive and repulsive terms through a Morse-like interaction with short-range Dirac Core Pressure:

	V(r) = D * (1 - exp(-Œ± * (r - r‚ÇÄ)))¬≤ - k / r ¬† (if r < cutoff)

The force derived from this potential (negative gradient of V) is split into two terms:

	F_total = (F_morse + F_dcp) * (x·µ¢ - x‚±º) / |x·µ¢ - x‚±º|
Where:

		F_morse = -2 * D * Œ± * (1 - e^(-Œ± * (r - r‚ÇÄ))) * e^(-Œ± * (r - r‚ÇÄ))

		F_dcp = k / r¬≤ (only active if r < cutoff)

The adaptive timestep DT is dynamically calculated every frame using local velocity and force magnitudes:

	DT = 0.001 * min(1.0, 0.1 / max_force, 0.1 / max_velocity)

Then smoothed:
	
	self.DT = 0.9 * self.DT + 0.1 * DT_dynamic

## üìä Results & Data Reproducibility

All test environments used the same workflow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Beelzebarb/sft.git
cd sft
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sft-cpu.py --headless
```

No manual patching or system-specific modifications required.

‚úîÔ∏è Runs consistently across Python 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12.

Each run generates a full log folder containing:
- `summary.csv` ‚Äî per-frame energy, cluster, and spatial statistics
- `cluster_lifetimes_size_x.csv` - Tracks cluster lifetimes by size x is replaced with cluster size, each gets its own csv for automation.
- `proton_binding_energy.csv` - per frame Proton Binding Energy statistics.
- `quantum_logs.csv` ‚Äî per-frame quantum activity: spin flips, color flips, timestep, and Hamiltonian diagnostics
- `metadata.json` ‚Äî config snapshot for full reproducibility

These results have been validated across a range of particle counts (`N=180` to `N=3000`) and environments, demonstrating long-term metastability or full stability.
